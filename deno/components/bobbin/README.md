# Bobbin – delicate circular symmetries

Weaving together technologies of the past and future, _Bobbin_ invites us to explore the delicate intricacies of
circular patterns. Mimicking the delicacy found in traditional crafts, _Bobbin_ leverages Svelte to enable us all to
become artists. Like modern day lace makers, we are invited to create our own designs and step back and admire the
possibilities of the web as a design tool. This tool celebrates the advancements we have made on seeing speedy results,
without compromising on elegance or beauty.

All the editing features use the web platform’s native toolset, which made Svelte & SvelteKit an ideal environment for
development:

- The design is encoded as state search parameter
- Undo and redo rely on the web history
- Patterns can be seen without without JavaScript with SSR
- The resulting SVG can be exported as-is and used as the basis for further work
- Animations are built with CSS and the Web Animation API

[Bobbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobbin_lace#Bobbins) are used to hold the thread to create lace, which was the
inspiration for this tool.
