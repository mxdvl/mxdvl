<h1>Maxâ€™s profile</h1>

<p>
	As a software engineer and designer, I transform complex ideas into refined products. Working with both client and
	user in mind, I create robust systems that are fast and accessible. Understanding what makes the world tick has led
	me to work across cultures and industries. I have lived and worked in the UK, Japan &amp; Canada, designing for
	non-profits, bespoke projects, hospitality, government bodies and property developers. Have a look at my work.

			<h2>The Guardian</h2>
			<h3>2020-now</h3>
			<p>
				I work on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/">TheGuardian.com</a> web platform, as a Senior Software Engineer.
				Starting out on the Commercial Development team, I played a key role in modernising the codebase. 2022 will
				see me joining the Dotcom team which oversees the web platform in its entirety.
			</p>
			<p>
				My main focus has been: modernisation JavaScript code, moving from Flow to TypeScript; optimisation of
				vector images <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">(SVG)</abbr>; various visualisations;
			</p>

			<h3>2010-2020</h3>
			<p>
				With over 10 years of experience building for the web, I have offered services ranging from fully
				managed websites to transitioning away from legacy platforms. In the last 5 years, I have focussed on
				bringing a single source of truth to 2D and 3D visualisation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Designed and built entire websites with news, portfolio and forms. Improved Google page speed insight by
				40-60 points on average on consultancy projects, meaning all web pages load fast. This was achieved by
				specifying better cache rules, optimizing database requests and leveraging distributed CDNs. World
				location mapping and styling with Leaflet. Integrated online payment with Stripe. Developed JSON APIs in
				PHP to expose data to collaborators. Conducted surveys in multiple languages and combined the data into
				live online spreadsheets.
			</p>

			<h2>Allies and Morrison LLP</h2>
			<h3>2018-2020</h3>
			<p>
				Assuming a role of building information modelling lead (BIM), I developed internal workflows and tools,
				oversaw data exchange with consultants and advised on technical improvements to the <a
					href="https://www.alliesandmorrison.com">company website</a
				>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Built testing tools for key project metrics using Grasshopper, ranging from sustainability to unit mix.
				Developed solar analysis tools leading to major savings in building envelope performance. Leveraged BIM
				to deliver project documentation on tight deadlines and trained the team throughout, exceeding targets.
				Streamlined internal scheduling systems using automation & PowerQuery.
			</p>

			<h2>Florian Busch Architects</h2>
			<h3>2016-2018</h3>
			<p>
				Assuming a role of technical lead, I helped define and implement data-driven design within the practice,
				an internal wiki and the <a href="https://www.florianbusch.com">public website</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Developed GIS analysis tools for development of a ski resort in Hokkaido. Produced pictures of an
				alternative 2020 Tokyo Olympic stadium, which was published in The Japan Times and ReThink Tokyo. Built
				complex digital generative and data-driven models. Taught scripting training sessions to fellow
				colleagues and improved workflow.
			</p>
			<p>
				Oversaw the transition of the office server to a faster, more robust and easy to extend infrastructure.
				The new system further allowed partners to access the office server remotely via VPN, a key feature when
				presenting projects to oversea clients. Built custom tools that were critical in winning two major
				projects in Hokkaido. Both relied on making complex spatial analysis expressed as simple and rich
				diagrams.
