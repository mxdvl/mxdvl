	As a software engineer and designer, I transform complex ideas into refined products. Working with both client and user in mind, I create robust systems that are fast and accessible. Understanding what makes the world tick and improving workflows has lead me to work across cultures and industries, including: the UK, Japan & Canada, designing for non-profits, bespoke projects, hospitality, government bodies and property developers. Have a look at my work.
